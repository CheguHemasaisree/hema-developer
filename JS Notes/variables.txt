variables:-javascript uses the variables are used to store the values.you can declare the variable by using var,let,const
    eg:-var a=5;(or)
        let a=5;(or)
        const a=5;


what is the difference between var let const?

var:-var is a function scoped variable which is used to recdeclare,reassign and can also be used before intilization
for eg:-  function(x){

             if(true){
                console.log(a)//can be used before intilization
                var a=5;//this is the declaration of var
                var a=25;//this is redeclaration of var
                a=10;//this is re-assigning of var
             }
             console.log(a)
         }
        x();

until 2015 javascript is used to use var variable.In 2015 javascript has introduced let and cons to declare the variable in new ways.

let and const:-let and const are block scoped variables which cannot be access before intilization and redeclartion is also not possible but reassign is supported by var and reassign is not supported by const

for eg:-    function(x){
              if(true){
                console.log(a);//this  is accessing before the intilization(shows undefined)
                let a=5;//decalaration of variable let
                a=40//re-assigning of let variable is possible
                let a=10;//redeclaration of let is not possible(throws an error)
                const a=10;//declaration of const variable
                const a=50;//redeclartion of const variable(throws an error)
                a=20;//re-assigning of const variable(throws an error)
                console.log(a);
              }
            }
            x();
